<h1>Terms and Conditions for Parenting 10x app</h1><br><hr><p>
#HTML</p>
<br><p>
<p></p>
<br><p>
By downloading or using the app, these terms will</p>
<br><p>
automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore</p>
<br><p>
that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not</p>
<br><p>
allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or</p>
<br><p>
our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to</p>
<br><p>
extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try</p>
<br><p>
to translate the app into other languages or make derivative</p>
<br><p>
versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,</p>
<br><p>
database rights, and other intellectual property rights related</p>
<br><p>
to it, still belong to Edge Effect Media.</p>
<br><p>
</p> <p></p>
<br><p>
Edge Effect Media is committed to ensuring that the app is</p>
<br><p>
as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we</p>
<br><p>
reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for</p>
<br><p>
its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never</p>
<br><p>
charge you for the app or its services without making it very</p>
<br><p>
clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
<br><p>
</p> <p></p>
<br><p>
The Parenting 10x app stores and processes personal data that</p>
<br><p>
you have provided to us, to provide our</p>
<br><p>
Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and</p>
<br><p>
access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do</p>
<br><p>
not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of</p>
<br><p>
removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the</p>
<br><p>
official operating system of your device. It could make your</p>
<br><p>
phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,</p>
<br><p>
compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean</p>
<br><p>
that the Parenting 10x app won’t work properly or at all.</p>
<br><p>
</p> <div><p></p>
<br><p>
The app does use third-party services that declare their</p>
<br><p>
Terms and Conditions.</p>

<br><p>
You should be aware that there are certain things that</p>
<br><p>
Edge Effect Media will not take responsibility for. Certain</p>
<br><p>
functions of the app will require the app to have an active</p>
<br><p>
internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided</p>
<br><p>
by your mobile network provider, but Edge Effect Media</p>
<br><p>
cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full</p>
<br><p>
functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t</p>
<br><p>
have any of your data allowance left.</p>
<br><p>
</p> <p></p> <p></p>
<br><p>
If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you</p>
<br><p>
should remember that the terms of the agreement with your</p>
<br><p>
mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may</p>
<br><p>
be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for</p>
<br><p>
the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or</p>
<br><p>
other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting</p>
<br><p>
responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data</p>
<br><p>
charges if you use the app outside of your home territory</p>
<br><p>
(i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If</p>
<br><p>
you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re</p>
<br><p>
using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have</p>
<br><p>
received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
<br><p>
</p> <p></p>
<br><p>
Along the same lines, Edge Effect Media cannot always take</p>
<br><p>
responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to</p>
<br><p>
make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of</p>
<br><p>
battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,</p>
<br><p>
Edge Effect Media cannot accept responsibility.</p>
<br><p>
</p> <p></p>
<br><p>
With respect to Edge Effect Media’s responsibility for your</p>
<br><p>
use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to</p>
<br><p>
bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is</p>
<br><p>
updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties</p>
<br><p>
to provide information to us so that we can make it available</p>
<br><p>
to you. Edge Effect Media accepts no liability for any</p>
<br><p>
loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of</p>
<br><p>
relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
<br><p>
</p> <p></p>
<br><p>
At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is</p>
<br><p>
currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for the </p>
<br><p>
both systems(and for any additional systems we</p>
<br><p>
decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,</p>
<br><p>
and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep</p>
<br><p>
using the app. Edge Effect Media does not promise that it</p>
<br><p>
will always update the app so that it is relevant to you</p>
<br><p>
and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have</p>
<br><p>
installed on your device. However, you promise to always</p>
<br><p>
accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may</p>
<br><p>
also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of</p>
<br><p>
it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.</p>
<br><p>
Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the</p>
<br><p>
rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;</p>
<br><p>
(b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it</p>
<br><p>
from your device.</p>
<br><p>
</p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p></p>
<br><p>
We may update our Terms and Conditions</p>
<br><p>
from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page</p>
<br><p>
periodically for any changes. We will</p>
